laser, a device that stimulates atoms or molecules to emit light at particular wavelengths and amplifies that light, typically producing a very narrow beam of radiation
The emission generally covers an extremely limited range of visible, infrared, or ultraviolet wavelengths.
Many different types of lasers have been developed, with highly varied characteristics. 
Laser is an acronym for â€œlight amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation The ability to focus laser beams onto very small spots and to switch them on and off billions of times per second makes lasers important tools in telecommunications and information processing. In laser supermarket scanners, a rotating mirror scans a red beam while clerks move packages across the beam. Optical sensors detect light reflected from striped bar codes
